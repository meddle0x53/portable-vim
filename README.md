# Portable Vim configuration example

This is a working example of portable vim configuration.
Try it like this:

  git clonr https://github.com/meddle0x53/portable-vim.git
  cd portable-vim
  vim -u .vimrc

You can play with it adding and removing bundles from the VundeFile. They won't affect your vim configuration only the project one.
